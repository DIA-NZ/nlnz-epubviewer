Version 1.0 (22.Aug.2014)

1) Basic stand-alone epubviewer created.

2) FilterMapping added in web.xml to view the restricted access epub files only through a valid Rosetta session and IP address.

3) MimeMapping added in web.xml for audio files to be correctly viewed in IE and Firefox. The actual mime-type for .m4a files is audio/mp4 and 
   the default mime-type is text/plain which doesn't work correctly in these browsers. It works fine with Chrome. We can add any other 
   mime-types to the list in future if required.

4) MP4 audio/video files doesn't work with latest Firefox (31.0) and IE10/11 even after making changes as mentioned in 3) in Windows XP
   (library machines) as these versions of browsers are not compatible with Windows XP. All works fine in Windows 7 machines.
Note: - Once the library machines are upgraded to Windows 7 this version of Epubviewer will automatically work. No need of any code changes.  

5) 'localepubviewer' servlet mapping in web.xml is only to be used for running epubviewer locally and STRICTLY to be commented when 
   the viewer is deployed to DEV/UAT/PROD environments. This was created as we don't have a valid Rosetta session in local.

6) Any changes to the epubviewer once deployed will automatically be reflected in MultiRepIEViewer and don't have to 
   separately deploy it for MultiRepIEViewer.
