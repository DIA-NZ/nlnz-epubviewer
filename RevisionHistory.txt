Version 1.0
====================================================================================
Release date	: 22.Aug.2014
Revisions		:
	- Basic stand-alone epubviewer created
	- FilterMapping added in web.xml to view the restricted access epub files only
	  through a valid Rosetta session and IP address
	- MimeMapping added in web.xml for audio files to be viewed in IE and Firefox.
	  The actual mime-type for .m4a files is audio/mp4 and the default mime-type
	  is text/plain which does not work in these browsers. It works fine with Chrome.
	  We can add other mime-types to the list in future if required.
	- MP4 audio/video files doesn't work with latest Firefox (31.0) and IE10/11 even
	  after making changes as mentioned above in Windows XP as these browser versions
	  are not compatible with Windows XP. Works fine in Windows 7.
	- 'localepubviewer' servlet mapping in web.xml is only to be used for
	  running epubviewer locally and STRICTLY to be commented when
	  the viewer is deployed to DEV/UAT/PROD environments.
	  This was created to support non-Rosetta sessions in local dev environment.
	- Any changes to the epubviewer once deployed will automatically be reflected in
	  MultiRepIEViewer and don't have to separately deploy it for MultiRepIEViewer.
